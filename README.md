# MÉTÉORE

[slideshow]: img.png "SlideShow"


METEORE is one of the largest engineering projects in my repository. It has been developed to compete in the THALES PROJECT ARDUINO CONTEST (France) organized by Agorize. My idea was to revolutionise the famous weather balloon with a module which are fitted with sensors : 510 DOF, L3GD20H, LSM303, BMP180, DTH22, RFM69HCW (Wireless - RF - LoRA), TEMT6000, GUVA-S12SD and the GPS ADAFRUIT. The objective of this module is connected with a Drone and it is to transmit the sensor data in RF.
